I started playing music at the age of 6 with piano. I stayed with it for 10 years. At the age of 15 i started to play bass by accident (as most of bass players i guess...).

After playing in some local rock bands for a while i decided to make my life into music. So, i bought myself an acoustic bass, decided to study music a bit more seriously and went to 2 music schools (one in Geneva - ETM, and a second one in Bern - Swiss Jazz School) from which i got a diploma in Performance and Music teaching.

I play all around Switzerland and Europe in a lot of different styles. Main projects : i.Trio, Espresso From Hell, Montreux Jazz On The Road Band, Gallavin (arranger, producer, bass),Time Grid, Papapitufo, Loraine Cotting, ...

I have played with Billy Cobham, Adam Nussbaum, Jacob Collier, Jerry Léonide, Claude Diallo, Sabine Kühlich, Gaël Rakotondrabé, Fred Bintner, Federico Casagrande, ..
