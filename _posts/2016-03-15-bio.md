  I started playing music at the age of 6 with piano. I stayed with it for 10
  years. At the age of 15 i started to play bass by accident (as most of bass
  players i guess...). After playing in some local rock bands for a while i
  decided to make my life into music. So, i bought myself an acoustic bass,
  decided to study music a bit more seriously and went to 2 music schools (one
  in Geneva - ETM, and a second one in Bern - Swiss Jazz School) from which i
  got a diploma in Performance and Music teaching. I play all around Switzerland
  and Europe in a lot of different styles. Main projects : i.Trio, Espresso From
  Hell, Montreux Jazz On The Road Band, Gallavin (arranger, producer, bass),Time
  Grid, Papapitufo, Loraine Cotting, ... I have played with Billy Cobham, Adam
  Nussbaum, Jacob Collier, Jerry Léonide, Claude Diallo, Sabine Kühlich, Gaël
  Rakotondrabé, Fred Bintner, Federico Casagrande, Chris Coleman, ...
