  I started playing music at the age of 6 with piano. I stayed with it for 10
  years. At the age of 15 i started to play bass by accident (as most of bass
  players i guess...).After playing in some local rock bands for a while i
  decided to make my life into music. So, i bought myself an acoustic bass,
  decided to study music a bit more seriously and went to 2 music schools (one
  in Geneva - ETM, and a second one in Bern - Swiss Jazz School) from which i
  got a diploma in Performance and Music teaching.I play all around Switzerland
  and Europe in a lot of different styles. Main projects : i.Trio, Espresso From
  Hell, Montreux Jazz On The Road Band, Gallavin (arranger, producer, bass),Time
  Grid, Papapitufo, Loraine Cotting, ...I have played with Billy Cobham, Adam
  Nussbaum, Jacob Collier, Jerry Léonide, Claude Diallo, Sabine Kühlich, Gaël
  Rakotondrabé, Fred Bintner, Federico Casagrande, Chris Coleman, ...
